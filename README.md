# A Lennard-Jones Molecular Dynamics Suite
A project from CHEM5555: Theoretical and Computational Chemistry. I performed simulations via force fields using the Lennard-Jones potential and computed some results that align nicely with expected results. The experiments mainly pertained to the radial distribution function (RDF), velocity autocorrelations, and mean square distances.
